# Eden Cheat Downloader

This application automates the process of downloading cheats from **Cheatslips** and organizing them into the specific folder structure required by the **Eden Emulator**.

## 💡 Motivation
I created this tool because I found it tedious to manually download and move/cut cheat files for Eden every single time. This downloader handles the organization for you.

## 🚀 Features
- Downloads cheats directly from Cheatslips.
- Automatically generates folder structures compatible with Eden.
- Built with **Flutter**.
  - *Note: While it may run on Windows and Linux, it has currently only been tested in a primary environment.*

## 🔑 Prerequisites & API Limits
To use this app, you need a **Cheatslips account** and an **API Token**.

- **API Limit:** Cheatslips allows only **3 requests per day** for free accounts.
- **How to Reset:** You can reset your daily request limit by watching ads on the [Cheatslips API Profile page](https://www.cheatslips.com/profile/api).
